# Plant Disease Detection

This project is a machine learning-based web application that detects plant diseases from uploaded images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It also suggests suitable fertilizers based on the detected disease. The application is built using Flask for the backend.

## 🚀 Features
- Upload an image of a plant leaf
- Detects plant diseases using a trained CNN model
- Suggests suitable fertilizers for treatment
- User-friendly web interface built with Flask

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN model)
- Flask (for web application)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for frontend)
